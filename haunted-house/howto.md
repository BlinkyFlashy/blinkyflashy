* switched battery pack


## Instructions
1. Assemble the Haunted House (yes, this is a big task. If you use the file from svgcuts, they have an awesome video tutorial on how to put it together). 
2. Attach the switched battery pack to the entrance to the house. 
3. Attach lights using the following basic circuit.
Note: I built paper boxes to house my lights so I could concentrate the light facing out of the windows. This also allowed me to mount the flat LED facing out. If you use standard LEDs, you probably are less likely to need this as you can point the LED in the direction you want it to be using the leads.
